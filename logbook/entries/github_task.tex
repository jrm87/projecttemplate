Asana is a project management tool used to assign tasks, impose deadlines, and track progress.

The project management tools for this project will be GitHub.
These support assigning tasks and accompanying discussion,
although sometimes it is not easy to assign deadlines to issues (but try GitHub's milestones). 
You might try to use Slack as a project management tool, but I have not enjoyed it.
It is better for free-flowing conversation than keeping a to-do list.

Asana is very expensive, and my experience with it is fiddly.
